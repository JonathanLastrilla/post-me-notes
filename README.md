will provide sophisticated way sometime.
## Notable Features
* Note Title
    * first line of the note will become the title
* Read/Write Mode
    * note can be locked to avoid accidental modification
* Quick Summary
    * consolidate all the last line of notes (filtered by color theme name, TODO)
* Backup
    * store all notes in a text file (TODO: restore)
